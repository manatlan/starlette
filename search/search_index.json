It is production-ready, and gives you the following: A lightweight, low-complexity HTTP web framework. WebSocket support. In-process background tasks. Startup and shutdown events. Test client built on requests . CORS, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses. Session and Cookie support. 100% test coverage. 100% type annotated codebase. Few hard dependencies. Compatible with asyncio and trio backends. Great overall performance against independent benchmarks . Requirements Python 3.7+ (For Python 3.6 support, install version 0.19.1) Installation $ pip3 install starlette You'll also want to install an ASGI server, such as uvicorn , daphne , or hypercorn . $ pip3 install uvicorn Example example.py : from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.responses import JSONResponse from starlette.routing import Route async def homepage ( request ): return JSONResponse ({ 'hello' : 'world' }) app = Starlette ( debug = True , routes = [ Route ( '/' , homepage ), ]) Then run the application... $ uvicorn example:app For a more complete example, see here . Dependencies Starlette only requires anyio , and the following dependencies are optional: requests - Required if you want to use the TestClient . jinja2 - Required if you want to use Jinja2Templates . python-multipart - Required if you want to support form parsing, with request.form() . itsdangerous - Required for SessionMiddleware support. pyyaml - Required for SchemaGenerator support. You can install all of these with pip3 install starlette[full] . Framework or Toolkit Starlette is designed to be used either as a complete framework, or as an ASGI toolkit. You can use any of its components independently. from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse async def app ( scope , receive , send ): assert scope [ 'type' ] == 'http' response = PlainTextResponse ( 'Hello, world!' ) await response ( scope , receive , send ) Run the app application in example.py : $ uvicorn example:app INFO: Started server process [ 11509 ] INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 ( Press CTRL+C to quit ) Run uvicorn with --reload to enable auto-reloading on code changes. Modularity The modularity that Starlette is designed on promotes building re-usable components that can be shared between any ASGI framework. This should enable an ecosystem of shared middleware and mountable applications. The clean API separation also means it's easier to understand each component in isolation.

A starlette application will always automatically include two middleware classes. ServerErrorMiddleware is added as the very outermost middleware, to handle any uncaught errors occurring anywhere in the entire stack. ExceptionMiddleware is added as the very innermost middleware, to deal with handled exception cases occurring in the routing or endpoints. exception_handlers - A mapping of either integer status codes, or exception class types onto callables which handle the exceptions.

It will be removed in a future release. The legacy documentation is available here . Here's a complete example, that includes table definitions, configuring a database.Database instance, and a couple of endpoints that interact with the database. .env DATABASE_URL = sqlite:///test.db app.py import databases import sqlalchemy from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.config import Config from starlette.responses import JSONResponse from starlette.routing import Route # Configuration from environment variables or '.env' file. config = Config ( '.env' ) DATABASE_URL = config ( 'DATABASE_URL' ) # Database table definitions. metadata = sqlalchemy . MetaData () notes = sqlalchemy . Table ( \"notes\" , metadata , sqlalchemy . Column ( \"id\" , sqlalchemy . Integer , primary_key = True ), sqlalchemy . Column ( \"text\" , sqlalchemy . String ), sqlalchemy . Column ( \"completed\" , sqlalchemy . Boolean ), ) database = databases . Database ( DATABASE_URL ) # Main application code. async def list_notes ( request ): query = notes . select () results = await database . fetch_all ( query ) content = [ { \"text\" : result [ \"text\" ], \"completed\" : result [ \"completed\" ] } for result in results ] return JSONResponse ( content ) async def add_note ( request ): data = await request . json () query = notes . insert () . values ( text = data [ \"text\" ], completed = data [ \"completed\" ] ) await database . execute ( query ) return JSONResponse ({ \"text\" : data [ \"text\" ], \"completed\" : data [ \"completed\" ] }) routes = [ Route ( \"/notes\" , endpoint = list_notes , methods = [ \"GET\" ]), Route ( \"/notes\" , endpoint = add_note , methods = [ \"POST\" ]), ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes , on_startup = [ database . connect ], on_shutdown = [ database . disconnect ] ) Finally, you will need to create the database tables. It is recommended to use Alembic, which we briefly go over in Migrations Queries Queries may be made with as SQLAlchemy Core queries . The following methods are supported: rows = await database.fetch_all(query) row = await database.fetch_one(query) async for row in database.iterate(query) await database.execute(query) await database.execute_many(query) Transactions Database transactions are available either as a decorator, as a context manager, or as a low-level API. Using a decorator on an endpoint: @database . transaction () async def populate_note ( request ): # This database insert occurs within a transaction. # It will be rolled back by the `RuntimeError`. query = notes . insert () . values ( text = \"you won't see me\" , completed = True ) await database . execute ( query ) raise RuntimeError () Using a context manager: async def populate_note ( request ): async with database . transaction (): # This database insert occurs within a transaction. # It will be rolled back by the `RuntimeError`. query = notes . insert () . values ( text = \"you won't see me\" , completed = True ) await request . database . execute ( query ) raise RuntimeError () Using the low-level API: async def populate_note ( request ): transaction = await database . transaction () try : # This database insert occurs within a transaction. # It will be rolled back by the `RuntimeError`. query = notes . insert () . values ( text = \"you won't see me\" , completed = True ) await database . execute ( query ) raise RuntimeError () except : await transaction . rollback () raise else : await transaction . commit () Test isolation There are a few things that we want to ensure when running tests against a service that uses a database. Our requirements should be: Use a separate database for testing. Create a new test database every time we run the tests. Ensure that the database state is isolated between each test case. Here's how we need to structure our application and tests in order to meet those requirements: from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.config import Config import databases config = Config ( \".env\" ) TESTING = config ( 'TESTING' , cast = bool , default = False ) DATABASE_URL = config ( 'DATABASE_URL' , cast = databases . DatabaseURL ) TEST_DATABASE_URL = DATABASE_URL . replace ( database = 'test_' + DATABASE_URL . database ) # Use 'force_rollback' during testing, to ensure we do not persist database changes # between each test case. if TESTING : database = databases . Database ( TEST_DATABASE_URL , force_rollback = True ) else : database = databases . Database ( DATABASE_URL ) We still need to set TESTING during a test run, and setup the test database. Assuming we're using py.test , here's how our conftest.py might look: import pytest from starlette.config import environ from starlette.testclient import TestClient from sqlalchemy import create_engine from sqlalchemy_utils import database_exists , create_database , drop_database # This sets `os.environ`, but provides some additional protection. # If we placed it below the application import, it would raise an error # informing us that 'TESTING' had already been read from the environment. environ [ 'TESTING' ] = 'True' import app @pytest . fixture ( scope = \"session\" , autouse = True ) def create_test_database (): \"\"\" Create a clean database on every test case. For safety, we should abort if a database already exists. We use the `sqlalchemy_utils` package here for a few helpers in consistently creating and dropping the database. \"\"\" url = str ( app .

For this we'd strongly recommend Alembic , which is written by the author of SQLAlchemy. $ pip install alembic $ alembic init migrations Now, you'll want to set things up so that Alembic references the configured DATABASE_URL, and uses your table metadata. In alembic.ini remove the following line: sqlalchemy.url = driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname In migrations/env.py , you need to set the 'sqlalchemy.url' configuration key, and the target_metadata variable. You'll want something like this: # The Alembic Config object. config = context . config # Configure Alembic to use our DATABASE_URL and our table definitions... import app config . set_main_option ( 'sqlalchemy.url' , str ( app . DATABASE_URL )) target_metadata = app . metadata ... Then, using our notes example above, create an initial revision: alembic revision -m \"Create notes table\" And populate the new file (within migrations/versions ) with the necessary directives: def upgrade (): op . create_table ( 'notes' , sqlalchemy . Column ( \"id\" , sqlalchemy . Integer , primary_key = True ), sqlalchemy . Column ( \"text\" , sqlalchemy . String ), sqlalchemy . Column ( \"completed\" , sqlalchemy . Boolean ), ) def downgrade (): op . drop_table ( 'notes' ) And run your first migration. Our notes app can now run! alembic upgrade head Running migrations during testing It is good practice to ensure that your test suite runs the database migrations every time it creates the test database. This will help catch any issues in your migration scripts, and will help ensure that the tests are running against a database that's in a consistent state with your live database.

In particular you might want to override how the built-in HTTPException class is handled. For example, to use JSON style responses: async def http_exception ( request : Request , exc : HTTPException ): return JSONResponse ({ \"detail\" : exc . detail }, status_code = exc . status_code ) exception_handlers = { HTTPException : http_exception } The HTTPException is also equipped with the headers argument. Which allows the propagation of the headers to the response class: async def http_exception ( request : Request , exc : HTTPException ): return JSONResponse ( { \"detail\" : exc . detail }, status_code = exc . status_code , headers = exc . headers ) Errors and handled exceptions It is important to differentiate between handled exceptions and errors. Handled exceptions do not represent error cases. They are coerced into appropriate HTTP responses, which are then sent through the standard middleware stack. By default the HTTPException class is used to manage any handled exceptions. Errors are any other exception that occurs within the application. These cases should bubble through the entire middleware stack as exceptions. Any error logging middleware should ensure that it re-raises the exception all the way up to the server. In practical terms, the error handled used is exception_handler[500] or exception_handler[Exception] . Both keys 500 and Exception can be used. See below: async def handle_error ( request : Request , exc : HTTPException ): # Perform some logic return JSONResponse ({ \"detail\" : exc . detail }, status_code = exc . status_code ) exception_handlers = { Exception : handle_error # or \"500: handle_error\" } It's important to notice that in case a BackgroundTask raises an exception, it will be handled by the handle_error function, but at that point, the response was already sent. In other words, the response created by handle_error will be discarded. In case the error happens before the response was sent, then it will use the response object - in the above example, the returned JSONResponse .

This is always the outermost middleware layer. ExceptionMiddleware - Adds exception handlers, so that particular types of expected exception cases can be associated with handler functions. For example raising HTTPException(status_code=404) within an endpoint will end up rendering a custom 404 page. Middleware is evaluated from top-to-bottom, so the flow of execution in our example application would look like this: Middleware ServerErrorMiddleware TrustedHostMiddleware HTTPSRedirectMiddleware ExceptionMiddleware Routing Endpoint The following middleware implementations are available in the Starlette package: CORSMiddleware Adds appropriate CORS headers to outgoing responses in order to allow cross-origin requests from browsers. The default parameters used by the CORSMiddleware implementation are restrictive by default, so you'll need to explicitly enable particular origins, methods, or headers, in order for browsers to be permitted to use them in a Cross-Domain context. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.middleware import Middleware from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware routes = ... middleware = [ Middleware ( CORSMiddleware , allow_origins = [ '*' ]) ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes , middleware = middleware ) The following arguments are supported: allow_origins - A list of origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. eg. ['https://example.org', 'https://www.example.org'] . You can use ['*'] to allow any origin. allow_origin_regex - A regex string to match against origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. eg. 'https://.*\\.example\\.org' . allow_methods - A list of HTTP methods that should be allowed for cross-origin requests. Defaults to ['GET'] . You can use ['*'] to allow all standard methods. allow_headers - A list of HTTP request headers that should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to [] . You can use ['*'] to allow all headers. The Accept , Accept-Language , Content-Language and Content-Type headers are always allowed for CORS requests. allow_credentials - Indicate that cookies should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to False . expose_headers - Indicate any response headers that should be made accessible to the browser. Defaults to [] . max_age - Sets a maximum time in seconds for browsers to cache CORS responses. Defaults to 600 . The middleware responds to two particular types of HTTP request... CORS preflight requests These are any OPTIONS request with Origin and Access-Control-Request-Method headers. In this case the middleware will intercept the incoming request and respond with appropriate CORS headers, and either a 200 or 400 response for informational purposes. Simple requests Any request with an Origin header. In this case the middleware will pass the request through as normal, but will include appropriate CORS headers on the response. SessionMiddleware Adds signed cookie-based HTTP sessions. Session information is readable but not modifiable. Access or modify the session data using the request.session dictionary interface. The following arguments are supported: secret_key - Should be a random string. session_cookie - Defaults to \"session\". max_age - Session expiry time in seconds. Defaults to 2 weeks. If set to None then the cookie will last as long as the browser session. same_site - SameSite flag prevents the browser from sending session cookie along with cross-site requests. Defaults to 'lax' . https_only - Indicate that Secure flag should be set (can be used with HTTPS only). Defaults to False . HTTPSRedirectMiddleware Enforces that all incoming requests must either be https or wss . Any incoming requests to http or ws will be redirected to the secure scheme instead. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.middleware.httpsredirect import HTTPSRedirectMiddleware routes = ... middleware = [ Middleware ( HTTPSRedirectMiddleware ) ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes , middleware = middleware ) There are no configuration options for this middleware class. TrustedHostMiddleware Enforces that all incoming requests have a correctly set Host header, in order to guard against HTTP Host Header attacks. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.middleware import Middleware from starlette.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware routes = ... middleware = [ Middleware ( TrustedHostMiddleware , allowed_hosts = [ 'example.com' , '*.example.com' ]) ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes , middleware = middleware ) The following arguments are supported: allowed_hosts - A list of domain names that should be allowed as hostnames. Wildcard domains such as *.example.com are supported for matching subdomains. To allow any hostname either use allowed_hosts=[\"*\"] or omit the middleware. If an incoming request does not validate correctly then a 400 response will be sent. GZipMiddleware Handles GZip responses for any request that includes \"gzip\" in the Accept-Encoding header. The middleware will handle both standard and streaming responses. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.middleware import Middleware from starlette.middleware.gzip import GZipMiddleware routes = ... middleware = [ Middleware ( GZipMiddleware , minimum_size = 1000 ) ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes , middleware = middleware ) The following arguments are supported: minimum_size - Do not GZip responses that are smaller than this minimum size in bytes. Defaults to 500 . BaseHTTPMiddleware An abstract class that allows you to write ASGI middleware against a request/response interface, rather than dealing with ASGI messages directly. To implement a middleware class using BaseHTTPMiddleware , you must override the async def dispatch(request, call_next) method. from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware class CustomHeaderMiddleware ( BaseHTTPMiddleware ): async def dispatch ( self , request , call_next ): response = await call_next ( request ) response . headers [ 'Custom' ] = 'Example' return response middleware = [ Middleware ( CustomHeaderMiddleware ) ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes , middleware = middleware ) If you want to provide configuration options to the middleware class you should override the __init__ method, ensuring that the first argument is app , and any remaining arguments are optional keyword arguments. Make sure to set the app attribute on the instance if you do this. class CustomHeaderMiddleware ( BaseHTTPMiddleware ): def __init__ ( self , app , header_value = 'Example' ): super () . __init__ ( app ) self . header_value = header_value async def dispatch ( self , request , call_next ): response = await call_next ( request ) response . headers [ 'Custom' ] = self . header_value return response middleware = [ Middleware ( CustomHeaderMiddleware , header_value = 'Customized' ) ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes , middleware = middleware ) Middleware classes should not modify their state outside of the __init__ method. Instead you should keep any state local to the dispatch method, or pass it around explicitly, rather than mutating the middleware instance. Bug Currently, the BaseHTTPMiddleware has some known issues: It's not possible to use BackgroundTasks with BaseHTTPMiddleware . Check #1438 for more details. Using BaseHTTPMiddleware will prevent changes to contextlib.ContextVar s from propagating upwards. That is, if you set a value for a ContextVar in your endpoint and try to read it from a middleware you will find that the value is not the same value you set in your endpoint (see this test for an example of this behavior). Using middleware in other frameworks To wrap ASGI middleware around other ASGI applications, you should use the more general pattern of wrapping the application instance: app = TrustedHostMiddleware ( app , allowed_hosts = [ 'example.com' ]) You can do this with a Starlette application instance too, but it is preferable to use the middleware=<List of Middleware instances> style, as it will: Ensure that everything remains wrapped in a single outermost ServerErrorMiddleware . Preserves the top-level app instance. Third party middleware asgi-auth-github This middleware adds authentication to any ASGI application, requiring users to sign in using their GitHub account (via OAuth ). Access can be restricted to specific users or to members of specific GitHub organizations or teams. asgi-csrf Middleware for protecting against CSRF attacks. This middleware implements the Double Submit Cookie pattern, where a cookie is set, then it is compared to a csrftoken hidden form field or an x-csrftoken HTTP header. AuthlibMiddleware A drop-in replacement for Starlette session middleware, using authlib's jwt module. BugsnagMiddleware A middleware class for logging exceptions to Bugsnag . CSRFMiddleware Middleware for protecting against CSRF attacks. This middleware implements the Double Submit Cookie pattern, where a cookie is set, then it is compared to an x-csrftoken HTTP header. EarlyDataMiddleware Middleware and decorator for detecting and denying TLSv1.3 early data requests. PrometheusMiddleware A middleware class for capturing Prometheus metrics related to requests and responses, including in progress requests, timing... ProxyHeadersMiddleware Uvicorn includes a middleware class for determining the client IP address, when proxy servers are being used, based on the X-Forwarded-Proto and X-Forwarded-For headers. For more complex proxy configurations, you might want to adapt this middleware. RateLimitMiddleware A rate limit middleware. Regular expression matches url; flexible rules; highly customizable. Very easy to use. RequestIdMiddleware A middleware class for reading/generating request IDs and attaching them to application logs. RollbarMiddleware A middleware class for logging exceptions, errors, and log messages to Rollbar . SentryMiddleware A middleware class for logging exceptions to Sentry . StarletteOpentracing A middleware class that emits tracing info to OpenTracing.io compatible tracers and can be used to profile and monitor distributed applications. TimingMiddleware A middleware class to emit timing information (cpu and wall time) for each request which passes through it. Includes examples for how to emit these timings as statsd metrics.

Please see #619 . GraphQL is not supported on Python 3.10. The executor parameter to GraphQLApp was removed. Use executor_class instead. The workers parameter to WSGIMiddleware was removed. This hasn't had any effect since Starlette v0.6.3. 0.14.2 February 2, 2021 Fixed Fixed ServerErrorMiddleware compatibility with Python 3.9.1/3.8.7 when debug mode is enabled - #1132 . Fixed unclosed socket ResourceWarning s when using the TestClient with WebSocket endpoints - #1132. Improved detection of async endpoints wrapped in functools.partial on Python 3.8+ - #1106 . 0.14.1 November 9th, 2020 Removed UJSONResponse was removed (this change was intended to be included in 0.14.0). Please see the documentation for how to implement responses using custom JSON serialization - #1074 . 0.14.0 November 8th, 2020 Added Starlette now officially supports Python3.9. In StreamingResponse , allow custom async iterator such as objects from classes implementing __aiter__ . Allow usage of functools.partial async handlers in Python versions 3.6 and 3.7. Add 418 I'm A Teapot status code. Changed Create tasks from handler coroutines before sending them to asyncio.wait . Use format_exception instead of format_tb in ServerErrorMiddleware 's debug responses. Be more lenient with handler arguments when using the requires decorator. 0.13.8 Revert Queue(maxsize=1) fix for BaseHTTPMiddleware middleware classes and streaming responses. The StaticFiles constructor now allows pathlib.Path in addition to strings for its directory argument. 0.13.7 Fix high memory usage when using BaseHTTPMiddleware middleware classes and streaming responses. 0.13.6 Fix 404 errors with StaticFiles . 0.13.5 Add support for Starlette(lifespan=...) functions. More robust path-traversal check in StaticFiles app. Fix WSGI PATH_INFO encoding. RedirectResponse now accepts optional background parameter Allow path routes to contain regex meta characters Treat ASGI HTTP 'body' as an optional key. Don't use thread pooling for writing to in-memory upload files. 0.13.0 Switch to promoting application configuration on init style everywhere. This means dropping the decorator style in favour of declarative routing tables and middleware definitions. 0.12.12 Fix request.url_for() for the Mount-within-a-Mount case. 0.12.11 Fix request.url_for() when an ASGI root_path is being used. 0.12.1 Add URL.include_query_params(**kwargs) Add URL.replace_query_params(**kwargs) Add URL.remove_query_params(param_names) request.state properly persisting across middleware. Added request.scope interface. 0.12.0 Switch to ASGI 3.0. Fixes to CORS middleware. Add StaticFiles(html=True) support. Fix path quoting in redirect responses. 0.11.1 Add request.state interface, for storing arbitrary additional information. Support disabling GraphiQL with GraphQLApp(..., graphiql=False) . 0.11.0 DatabaseMiddleware is now dropped in favour of databases Templates are no longer configured on the application instance. Use templates = Jinja2Templates(directory=...) and return templates.TemplateResponse('index.html', {\"request\": request}) Schema generation is no longer attached to the application instance. Use schemas = SchemaGenerator(...) and return schemas.OpenAPIResponse(request=request) LifespanMiddleware is dropped in favor of router-based lifespan handling. Application instances now accept a routes argument, Starlette(routes=[...]) Schema generation now includes mounted routes. 0.10.6 Add Lifespan routing component. 0.10.5 Ensure templating does not strictly require jinja2 to be installed. 0.10.4 Templates are now configured independently from the application instance. templates = Jinja2Templates(directory=...) . Existing API remains in place, but is no longer documented, and will be deprecated in due course. See the template documentation for more details. 0.10.3 Move to independent databases package instead of DatabaseMiddleware . Existing API remains in place, but is no longer documented, and will be deprecated in due course. 0.10.2 Don't drop explicit port numbers on redirects from HTTPSRedirectMiddleware . 0.10.1 Add MySQL database support. Add host-based routing. 0.10.0 WebSockets now default to sending/receiving JSON over text data frames. Use .send_json(data, mode=\"binary\") and .receive_json(mode=\"binary\") for binary framing. GraphQLApp now takes an executor_class argument, which should be used in preference to the existing executor argument. Resolves an issue with async executors being instantiated before the event loop was setup. The executor argument is expected to be deprecated in the next median or major release. Authentication and the @requires decorator now support WebSocket endpoints. MultiDict and ImmutableMultiDict classes are available in uvicorn.datastructures . QueryParams is now instantiated with standard dict-style *args, **kwargs arguments. 0.9.11 Session cookies now include browser 'expires', in addition to the existing signed expiry. request.form() now returns a multi-dict interface.

This allows eg: app.mount('/static', StaticFiles(directory='static'), name='static') . 0.7.2 Middleware Add support for @app.middleware(\"http\") decorator. Routing Add \"endpoint\" to ASGI scope. 0.7.1 Debug tracebacks Improve debug traceback information & styling. URL routing Support mounted URL lookups with \"path=\", eg. url_for('static', path=...) . Support nested URL lookups, eg. url_for('admin:user', username=...) . Add redirect slashes support. Add www redirect support. Background tasks Add background task support to FileResponse and StreamingResponse . 0.7.0 API Schema support Add app.schema_generator = SchemaGenerator(...) . Add app.schema property. Add OpenAPIResponse(...) . GraphQL routing Drop app.add_graphql_route(\"/\", ...) in favor of more consistent app.add_route(\"/\", GraphQLApp(...)) . 0.6.3 Routing API Support routing to methods. Ensure url_path_for works with Mount('/{some_path_params}'). Fix Router(default=) argument. Support repeated paths, like: @app.route(\"/\", methods=[\"GET\"]) , @app.route(\"/\", methods=[\"POST\"]) Use the default ThreadPoolExecutor for all sync endpoints. 0.6.2 SessionMiddleware Added support for request.session , with SessionMiddleware . 0.6.1 BaseHTTPMiddleware Added support for BaseHTTPMiddleware , which provides a standard request/response interface over a regular ASGI middleware. This means you can write ASGI middleware while still working at a request/response level, rather than handling ASGI messages directly. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware class CustomMiddleware ( BaseHTTPMiddleware ): async def dispatch ( self , request , call_next ): response = await call_next ( request ) response . headers [ 'Custom-Header' ] = 'Example' return response app = Starlette () app . add_middleware ( CustomMiddleware ) 0.6.0 request.path_params The biggest change in 0.6 is that endpoint signatures are no longer: async def func ( request : Request , ** kwargs ) -> Response Instead we just use: async def func ( request : Request ) -> Response The path parameters are available on the request as request.path_params .

Request Signature: Request(scope, receive=None) from starlette.requests import Request from starlette.responses import Response async def app ( scope , receive , send ): assert scope [ 'type' ] == 'http' request = Request ( scope , receive ) content = ' %s %s ' % ( request . method , request . url . path ) response = Response ( content , media_type = 'text/plain' ) await response ( scope , receive , send ) Requests present a mapping interface, so you can use them in the same way as a scope . For instance: request['path'] will return the ASGI path. If you don't need to access the request body you can instantiate a request without providing an argument to receive . Method The request method is accessed as request.method . URL The request URL is accessed as request.url . The property is a string-like object that exposes all the components that can be parsed out of the URL. For example: request.url.path , request.url.port , request.url.scheme . Headers Headers are exposed as an immutable, case-insensitive, multi-dict. For example: request.headers['content-type'] Query Parameters Query parameters are exposed as an immutable multi-dict. For example: request.query_params['search'] Path Parameters Router path parameters are exposed as a dictionary interface. For example: request.path_params['username'] Client Address The client's remote address is exposed as a named two-tuple request.client . Either item in the tuple may be None . The hostname or IP address: request.client.host The port number from which the client is connecting: request.client.port Cookies Cookies are exposed as a regular dictionary interface. For example: request.cookies.get('mycookie') Cookies are ignored in case of an invalid cookie. (RFC2109) Body There are a few different interfaces for returning the body of the request: The request body as bytes: await request.body() The request body, parsed as form data or multipart: await request.form() The request body, parsed as JSON: await request.json() You can also access the request body as a stream, using the async for syntax: from starlette.requests import Request from starlette.responses import Response async def app ( scope , receive , send ): assert scope [ 'type' ] == 'http' request = Request ( scope , receive ) body = b '' async for chunk in request . stream (): body += chunk response = Response ( body , media_type = 'text/plain' ) await response ( scope , receive , send ) If you access .stream() then the byte chunks are provided without storing the entire body to memory. Any subsequent calls to .body() , .form() , or .json() will raise an error. In some cases such as long-polling, or streaming responses you might need to determine if the client has dropped the connection. You can determine this state with disconnected = await request.is_disconnected() . Request Files Request files are normally sent as multipart form data ( multipart/form-data ). When you call await request.form() you receive a starlette.datastructures.FormData which is an immutable multidict, containing both file uploads and text input. File upload items are represented as instances of starlette.datastructures.UploadFile . UploadFile has the following attributes: filename : A str with the original file name that was uploaded (e.g. myimage.jpg ). content_type : A str with the content type (MIME type / media type) (e.g. image/jpeg ). file : A SpooledTemporaryFile (a file-like object). This is the actual Python file that you can pass directly to other functions or libraries that expect a \"file-like\" object. headers : A Headers object. Often this will only be the Content-Type header, but if additional headers were included in the multipart field they will be included here. Note that these headers have no relationship with the headers in Request.headers . UploadFile has the following async methods. They all call the corresponding file methods underneath (using the internal SpooledTemporaryFile ). async write(data) : Writes data ( bytes ) to the file. async read(size) : Reads size ( int ) bytes of the file. async seek(offset) : Goes to the byte position offset ( int ) in the file. E.g., await myfile.seek(0) would go to the start of the file. async close() : Closes the file. As all these methods are async methods, you need to \"await\" them.

When you call await request.form() you receive a starlette.datastructures.FormData which is an immutable multidict, containing both file uploads and text input.

UploadFile has the following attributes: filename : A str with the original file name that was uploaded (e.g. myimage.jpg ). content_type : A str with the content type (MIME type / media type) (e.g. image/jpeg ). file : A SpooledTemporaryFile (a file-like object). This is the actual Python file that you can pass directly to other functions or libraries that expect a \"file-like\" object. headers : A Headers object. Often this will only be the Content-Type header, but if additional headers were included in the multipart field they will be included here. Note that these headers have no relationship with the headers in Request.headers . UploadFile has the following async methods. They all call the corresponding file methods underneath (using the internal SpooledTemporaryFile ). async write(data) : Writes data ( bytes ) to the file. async read(size) : Reads size ( int ) bytes of the file. async seek(offset) : Goes to the byte position offset ( int ) in the file. E.g., await myfile.seek(0) would go to the start of the file. async close() : Closes the file. As all these methods are async methods, you need to \"await\" them.

A routing table is defined as a list of routes, and passed when instantiating the application. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse from starlette.routing import Route async def homepage ( request ): return PlainTextResponse ( \"Homepage\" ) async def about ( request ): return PlainTextResponse ( \"About\" ) routes = [ Route ( \"/\" , endpoint = homepage ), Route ( \"/about\" , endpoint = about ), ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes ) The endpoint argument can be one of: A regular function or async function, which accepts a single request argument and which should return a response. A class that implements the ASGI interface, such as Starlette's HTTPEndpoint . Path Parameters Paths can use URI templating style to capture path components. Route ( '/users/ {username} ' , user ) By default this will capture characters up to the end of the path or the next / . You can use convertors to modify what is captured. The available convertors are: str returns a string, and is the default. int returns a Python integer. float returns a Python float. uuid return a Python uuid.UUID instance. path returns the rest of the path, including any additional / characters. Convertors are used by prefixing them with a colon, like so: Route ( '/users/{user_id:int}' , user ) Route ( '/floating-point/{number:float}' , floating_point ) Route ( '/uploaded/{rest_of_path:path}' , uploaded ) If you need a different converter that is not defined, you can create your own. See below an example on how to create a datetime convertor, and how to register it: from datetime import datetime from starlette.convertors import Convertor , register_url_convertor class DateTimeConvertor ( Convertor ): regex = \"[0-9] {4} -[0-9] {2} -[0-9] {2} T[0-9] {2} :[0-9] {2} :[0-9] {2} (.[0-9]+)?\" def convert ( self , value : str ) -> datetime : return datetime . strptime ( value , \"%Y-%m- %d T%H:%M:%S\" ) def to_string ( self , value : datetime ) -> str : return value . strftime ( \"%Y-%m- %d T%H:%M:%S\" ) register_url_convertor ( \"datetime\" , DateTimeConvertor ()) After registering it, you'll be able to use it as: Route ( '/history/{date:datetime}' , history ) Path parameters are made available in the request, as the request.path_params dictionary. async def user ( request ): user_id = request . path_params [ 'user_id' ] ... Handling HTTP methods Routes can also specify which HTTP methods are handled by an endpoint: Route ( '/users/{user_id:int}' , user , methods = [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" ]) By default function endpoints will only accept GET requests, unless specified. Submounting routes In large applications you might find that you want to break out parts of the routing table, based on a common path prefix. routes = [ Route ( '/' , homepage ), Mount ( '/users' , routes = [ Route ( '/' , users , methods = [ 'GET' , 'POST' ]), Route ( '/ {username} ' , user ), ]) ] This style allows you to define different subsets of the routing table in different parts of your project. from myproject import users , auth routes = [ Route ( '/' , homepage ), Mount ( '/users' , routes = users . routes ), Mount ( '/auth' , routes = auth . routes ), ] You can also use mounting to include sub-applications within your Starlette application. For example... # This is a standalone static files server: app = StaticFiles ( directory = \"static\" ) # This is a static files server mounted within a Starlette application, # underneath the \"/static\" path. routes = [ ... Mount ( \"/static\" , app = StaticFiles ( directory = \"static\" ), name = \"static\" ) ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes ) Reverse URL lookups You'll often want to be able to generate the URL for a particular route, such as in cases where you need to return a redirect response. routes = [ Route ( \"/\" , homepage , name = \"homepage\" ) ] # We can use the following to return a URL... url = request . url_for ( \"homepage\" ) URL lookups can include path parameters... routes = [ Route ( \"/users/ {username} \" , user , name = \"user_detail\" ) ] # We can use the following to return a URL... url = request . url_for ( \"user_detail\" , username =... ) If a Mount includes a name , then submounts should use a {prefix}:{name} style for reverse URL lookups. routes = [ Mount ( \"/users\" , name = \"users\" , routes = [ Route ( \"/\" , user , name = \"user_list\" ), Route ( \"/ {username} \" , user , name = \"user_detail\" ) ]) ] # We can use the following to return URLs... url = request . url_for ( \"users:user_list\" ) url = request . url_for ( \"users:user_detail\" , username =... ) Mounted applications may include a path=... parameter. routes = [ ... Mount ( \"/static\" , app = StaticFiles ( directory = \"static\" ), name = \"static\" ) ] # We can use the following to return URLs... url = request . url_for ( \"static\" , path = \"/css/base.css\" ) For cases where there is no request instance, you can make reverse lookups against the application, although these will only return the URL path. url = app . url_path_for ( \"user_detail\" , username =... ) Host-based routing If you want to use different routes for the same path based on the Host header. Note that port is removed from the Host header when matching. For example, Host (host='example.org:3600', ...) will be processed even if the Host header contains or does not contain a port other than 3600 ( example.org:5600 , example.org ). Therefore, you can specify the port if you need it for use in url_for . There are several ways to connect host-based routes to your application site = Router () # Use eg. `@site.route()` to configure this. api = Router () # Use eg. `@api.route()` to configure this. news = Router () # Use eg. `@news.route()` to configure this. routes = [ Host ( 'api.example.org' , api , name = \"site_api\" ) ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes ) app . host ( 'www.example.org' , site , name = \"main_site\" ) news_host = Host ( 'news.example.org' , news ) app . router . routes . append ( news_host ) URL lookups can include host parameters just like path parameters routes = [ Host ( \" {subdomain} .example.org\" , name = \"sub\" , app = Router ( routes = [ Mount ( \"/users\" , name = \"users\" , routes = [ Route ( \"/\" , user , name = \"user_list\" ), Route ( \"/ {username} \" , user , name = \"user_detail\" ) ]) ])) ] ... url = request . url_for ( \"sub:users:user_detail\" , username =... , subdomain =... ) url = request . url_for ( \"sub:users:user_list\" , subdomain =... ) Route priority Incoming paths are matched against each Route in order. In cases where more that one route could match an incoming path, you should take care to ensure that more specific routes are listed before general cases. For example: # Don't do this: `/users/me` will never match incoming requests. routes = [ Route ( '/users/ {username} ' , user ), Route ( '/users/me' , current_user ), ] # Do this: `/users/me` is tested first. routes = [ Route ( '/users/me' , current_user ), Route ( '/users/ {username} ' , user ), ] Working with Router instances If you're working at a low-level you might want to use a plain Router instance, rather that creating a Starlette application. This gives you a lightweight ASGI application that just provides the application routing, without wrapping it up in any middleware. app = Router ( routes = [ Route ( '/' , homepage ), Mount ( '/users' , routes = [ Route ( '/' , users , methods = [ 'GET' , 'POST' ]), Route ( '/ {username} ' , user ), ]) ]) WebSocket Routing When working with WebSocket endpoints, you should use WebSocketRoute instead of the usual Route . Path parameters, and reverse URL lookups for WebSocketRoute work the the same as HTTP Route , which can be found in the HTTP Route section above. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.routing import WebSocketRoute async def websocket_index ( websocket ): await websocket . accept () await websocket . send_text ( \"Hello, websocket!\" ) await websocket . close () async def websocket_user ( websocket ): name = websocket . path_params [ \"name\" ] await websocket . accept () await websocket . send_text ( f \"Hello, { name } \" ) await websocket . close () routes = [ WebSocketRoute ( \"/\" , endpoint = websocket_index ), WebSocketRoute ( \"/ {name} \" , endpoint = websocket_user ), ] app = Starlette ( routes = routes ) The endpoint argument can be one of: An async function, which accepts a single websocket argument.

WebSocket Signature: WebSocket(scope, receive=None, send=None) from starlette.websockets import WebSocket async def app ( scope , receive , send ): websocket = WebSocket ( scope = scope , receive = receive , send = send ) await websocket . accept () await websocket . send_text ( 'Hello, world!' ) await websocket . close () WebSockets present a mapping interface, so you can use them in the same way as a scope . For instance: websocket['path'] will return the ASGI path. URL The websocket URL is accessed as websocket.url . The property is actually a subclass of str , and also exposes all the components that can be parsed out of the URL. For example: websocket.url.path , websocket.url.port , websocket.url.scheme . Headers Headers are exposed as an immutable, case-insensitive, multi-dict. For example: websocket.headers['sec-websocket-version'] Query Parameters Query parameters are exposed as an immutable multi-dict. For example: websocket.query_params['search'] Path Parameters Router path parameters are exposed as a dictionary interface. For example: websocket.path_params['username'] Accepting the connection await websocket.accept(subprotocol=None, headers=None) Sending data await websocket.send_text(data) await websocket.send_bytes(data) await websocket.send_json(data) JSON messages default to being sent over text data frames, from version 0.10.0 onwards. Use websocket.send_json(data, mode=\"binary\") to send JSON over binary data frames. Receiving data await websocket.receive_text() await websocket.receive_bytes() await websocket.receive_json() May raise starlette.websockets.WebSocketDisconnect() . JSON messages default to being received over text data frames, from version 0.10.0 onwards. Use websocket.receive_json(data, mode=\"binary\") to receive JSON over binary data frames. Closing the connection await websocket.close(code=1000, reason=None) Sending and receiving messages If you need to send or receive raw ASGI messages then you should use websocket.send() and websocket.receive() rather than using the raw send and receive callables.
